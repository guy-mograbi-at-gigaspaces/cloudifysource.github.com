h2. The Cloudify Recipe Repository 

Cloudify Web UI has a functionality called the recipe repository. By default, this functionality is turned off. 
When turned on, the Cloudify manager will clone the Cloudify recipes repository to the local disk and allow you to browse it, modify files and install services and applications.

h4(info). The repository feature is not a full-blown VCS at this point. Cloudify does not commit or push code changes to the cloned remote repository. It simply clones the content of the repository to the local disk. Updating the content of a file simply updates the content of that file on the local disk of the Cloudify manager. 
The repository implements basic collision detection which prevents you from saving a file after another user has changed it while you were editing it. 

Here's a screenshot that shows the recipes tab:

h2. Configuration

The webui has a spring context XML file called "cloudify-webui-context.xml" : 
<script src="https://gist.github.com/tamirko/5230978.js"></script>

You can define your own file which overrides the cloudify-webui-context.xml.
For localcloud you place it under the "config" folder under CloudifyRoot folder and for remote clouds you will place it under a cloudify-overrides (e.g.: For EC2, place the file in CloudifyRoot/clouds/ec2/upload/cloudify-overrides/config/cloudify-webui-context-override.xml). 
The overriding file should be named "cloudify-webui-context-override.xml". <a href="cloudify-webui-override.xml">Download example</a>.



# _recipesRepository_ ( default false ) if set to true, turns the repository feature on.
# _URI_ - ( default <a href="https://github.com/CloudifySource/cloudify-recipes" target="_blank">Cloudify Recipes</a> ) recipes will be cloned from this GIT repository.
# _rootFolder_ ( default "cloudify_recipes_clone" ) recipes will be cloned to this folder.
# _existingMethod_ - ( default "USE_IF_VALID" )
## "USE" - rootFolder found will be used.
## "USE_IF_VALID" - rootFolder is validated first. If invalid it is deleted and a new clone is made.

Here's an override example:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/tamirko/5230984.js"></script>

This configuration also allows you to modify the implementation of the interface. 
The interface is available as a MAVEN dependency with the following details :
<script src="https://gist.github.com/tamirko/5230970.js"></script>

h2. Using the Recipes Tab

The recipe repository tab enables you to modify a recipe and then install it.
